# OAI2Rosetta
## Prerequisites
* Java >1.8, for building you need the JDK
* a mysql DB for holding the data
## Installing
Building and installing is possible with sbt. There is a ./sbt launcher shipped with this application. sbt will download all dependencies.

* `./sbt run` will build and run the application. Be sure to have a database.
## Configuring
Configuring is done in the `conf/application.conf` file. Especially interesting is:
* `db.default.url`
* `importdirectory`
## Initial Run
If the database schema is not installed yet set `play.evolutions.enabled=trueÂ´ and follow the intstruction in the browser.

in `conf/initial-user.yml` is an initial user that is inserted in an empty db.

Users are for basic authentification, but there is no usermanagement. So users have to be added manually in the DB.
## Deployment

* `./sbt dist` will build a zip package in target/universal
* `./sbt universal:packageZipTarball` will build a gz package in target/universal
* `./sbt universal:packageZipTarball` will create a tgz. Copy it into your target environment and unpack it. Execute bin/dspacesubapp and the application will run.
* `./sbt dist` will build a zip package in target/universal
* You can also build a deb or rpm package with `debian:packageBin` [see](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/archetypes/java_server/index.html)

You can add a special config file into config. It will overwrite settings made in `application.conf`. To use it execute `bin/dspacesubapp -Dconfig.resource=prod.conf`

There is an example for system.d file in `dist/oai2rosetta.service`. When build it is in the root path oaf th app.
    
    - configure your paths
    - copy dspacesubapp.service in /etc/systemd/system/
    - systemctl daemon-reload
    - systemctl start oai2rosetta.
    - systemctl status oai2rosetta.
    - systemctl stop oai2rosetta.
    - systemctl enable oai2rosetta.
